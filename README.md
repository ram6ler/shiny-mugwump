## Introduction

 _Mugwump_ is a very old, text-only computer game that appeared in the 1978 book:

*  __AHL, D.__ (editor): _BASIC Computer Games_, Workman Publishing, New York, 1978

(The book is archived at [atariarchives.org](http://atariarchives.org/) and may be viewed [here](http://atariarchives.org/basicgames/))

_Shiny Mugwump_ is a remake of _Mugwump_ using the R Shiny package, created as a project for the Coursera / JHU course [_Developing Data Products_](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod).
